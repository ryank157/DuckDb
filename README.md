## About the book

DuckDB in Action will show you how to quickly get your hands dirty with [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org). 
You won’t need to read through pages of documentation—you’ll learn as you work. Begin with DuckDB’s CLI embedded mode, then dive straight into modern SQL queries and utilizing DuckDB’s handy SQL extensions.
From there, you’ll explore the different ways you can analyze data with DuckDB, including advanced aggregation and analysis, data without persistence, and DuckDB’s underlying architecture. Learn how to combine DuckDB with the Python ecosystem for even greater customization, and how to extend DuckDB with its own tools. 
You’ll take to DuckDB like a duck to water, rapidly solving almost any relational data task with zero friction.
